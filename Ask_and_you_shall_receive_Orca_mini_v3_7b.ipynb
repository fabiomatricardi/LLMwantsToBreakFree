Here are a bunch of recommendations that the In Plain English team consider to be best practices when writing articles that your readers will find engaging and easy-to-read. Written  by Sunil Sandhu. Take a moment to give your article a good title and subtitle. Try to make them concise, yet compelling. If in doubt, ask yourself: ‚ÄúWould I find this title interesting enough that I would want to continue to read the article?‚Äù Don‚Äôt create weird formats for your headings and subheadings. Just keep them simple and make sure that the formatting for each heading/subheading in your article is consistent with one another. If you are planning on numbering your headings, here are some examples for you to refer to‚Ä¶ Half-baked articles look bad. If you cannot be bothered to take the time to write your article in a way that has good structure, good punctuation, good spelling, and good formatting, what makes you think that somebody else is going to spend good time reading it? Take pride in your work. Your writing is an extension of who you are as a person, especially in a professional context. If you are writing about code, it is likely that you have aspirations to work with software, or already do. The words you write represent that, so make sure you do a good job of representing yourself! Capitalise the start of every sentence. Regarding articles that have a 2‚Äì3min read time - have you definitely covered everything that your article needs and your readers expect?  Following on from the previous point, research has shown that articles of 7‚Äì8mins appear to perform best. If you are not confident that your level of English is perfect/near-perfect, try running your article through some writing software that has the language set to English (UK) or English (US). Try writing your article in Google Docs. Some people swear by Grammarly. While Grammarly is a nice tool for improving the quality of your content, we have still come across far too many writers who swear they have used Grammarly to check their work, yet it still contains simple errors. Even if you're confident in your English, I would still recommend using these tools. If in doubt about those any of those three previous points, go ahead and read your own article back. Consider whether you still think your article is good enough for other people to spend time reading. Hopefully it is! üôÇ Don‚Äôt overuse emojis! Don‚Äôt overuse GIFs and memes.```\"\"\"\n",
